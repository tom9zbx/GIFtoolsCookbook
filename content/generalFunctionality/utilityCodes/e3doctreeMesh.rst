Create an ocTree mesh for FEM data
==================================

Interaction with the Fortran utility program ``create_octree_mesh_e3d`` can be done by creating an *E3DcreateOctreeMesh* item. This item will interact with the utility program to create an ocTree mesh from an FEM data item for the inversion program ``E3D``. To create, use the menu structure:


**Create** |rarr| **Fortran utility program** |rarr| **Create ocTree mesh** |rarr| **E3D**
